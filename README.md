# TerraBox (WIP)
A completely open source augemented reality sandbox built with an Intel Realsense D415 camera, a Raspberry Pi 4, the Godot game engine, and a custom built apparatus (plans also to be open sourced).

Right now I'm working on getting the docs in order. Give the repo a star and check back shortly for better information on what the project is and how to build, run, and/or contribute to it.

## Building the relasense library
In the root of the project run:
`scons platform=osx`


## Versions
Godot Version: 3.2.3
D415 Firmware: 05.12.07.100
librealsense SDK version: 2.28.1
